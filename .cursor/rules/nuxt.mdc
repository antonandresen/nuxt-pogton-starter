# Nuxt 4

You have extensive expertise in Vue 3, Nuxt 4, TypeScript, Node.js, Vite, Vue Router, Pinia, VueUse, Shadcn (shadcn-vue), and Tailwind CSS. You possess a deep knowledge of best practices and performance optimization techniques across these technologies.

Code Style and Structure
- Write clean, maintainable, and technically accurate TypeScript code.
- Prioritize functional and declarative programming patterns; avoid using classes.
- Emphasize iteration and modularization to follow DRY principles and minimize code duplication.
- Prefer Composition API <script setup> style.
- Use Composables to encapsulate and share reusable client-side logic or state across multiple components in your Nuxt application.

Nuxt 4 Specifics
- Nuxt 4 provides auto imports, so theres no need to manually import 'ref', 'useState', or 'useRouter'.
- For color mode handling, use the built-in '@nuxtjs/color-mode' with the 'useColorMode()' function.
- Take advantage of VueUse functions to enhance reactivity and performance (except for color mode management).
- Use the Server API (within the server/api directory) to handle server-side operations like database interactions, authentication, or processing sensitive data that must remain confidential.
- Prefer direct Convex queries/mutations from the client (use `useConvexQuery` / `useConvexMutation`) for app data that benefits from live sync.
- Only keep Nuxt server API routes when secrets or non-Convex side effects are required (Stripe, email, webhooks, file uploads).
- All client data access should flow through Convex functions that enforce `ctx.auth` and org permissions.
- Do not add CRUD-style data endpoints under `server/api`. If it can be a Convex query/mutation, it must be.
- Allowed `server/api` routes: auth session issuance, Convex auth token/JWKS, Stripe/webhooks, and non-Convex side effects.
- use useRuntimeConfig to access and manage runtime configuration variables that differ between environments and are needed both on the server and client sides.
- For SEO use useHead and useSeoMeta.
- For images use <NuxtImage> or <NuxtPicture> component and for Icons use lucide-vue-next.

Fetching Data
1. Use useFetch for standard data fetching in components that benefit from SSR, caching, and reactively updating based on URL changes. 
2. Use $fetch for client-side requests within event handlers or when SSR optimization is not needed.
3. Use useAsyncData when implementing complex data fetching logic like combining multiple API calls or custom caching and error handling.
4. Set server: false in useFetch or useAsyncData options to fetch data only on the client side, bypassing SSR.
5. Set lazy: true in useFetch or useAsyncData options to defer non-critical data fetching until after the initial render.

Naming Conventions
- Utilize composables, naming them as use<MyComposable>.
- Use **PascalCase** for component file names (e.g., components/MyComponent.vue).
- Favor named exports for functions to maintain consistency and readability.

TypeScript Usage
- Use TypeScript throughout; prefer interfaces over types for better extendability and merging.
- Avoid enums, opting for maps for improved type safety and flexibility.
- Use functional components with TypeScript interfaces.

UI and Styling
- Use Shadcn (shadcn-vue) and Tailwind CSS for components and styling.
  - Shadcn is located under app/components/ui
- Implement responsive design with Tailwind CSS; use a mobile-first approach.
