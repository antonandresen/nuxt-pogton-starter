description: Use index pages inside folders for Nuxt routing

# Nuxt pages should use folder + index.vue

- Prefer `app/pages/foo.vue` for non-nested routes
- Never keep both a file and a folder with the same name in `app/pages`
- If a route needs children, move it into a folder and use `index.vue`

Examples:

✅ `app/pages/dashboard/orgs.vue` (no children)
✅ `app/pages/dashboard/orgs/index.vue` + `app/pages/dashboard/orgs/[orgId]/index.vue`
❌ `app/pages/dashboard/orgs.vue` + `app/pages/dashboard/orgs/`
